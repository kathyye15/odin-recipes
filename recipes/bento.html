        <li>1 teaspoon mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon tamari</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tamari</li>

        <li>1/8 teaspoon wasabi paste</li>
        <1i>1/4 cup steamed broccoli florets</1i>
        <li>1/2 cup cooked shelled edamame</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse rice with cool water until the water runs clear; drain. 
            Bring rice and 3/4 cup water to a boil in a pot. Reduce heat and let simmer until water is absorbed, 
            about 15 minutes. Let cool, 10 to 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Cut the sheet of nori into two 1-inch strips; reserve the remainder of the sheet for making tamagoyaki.
        </li>
        <li>Wet your hands and form the cooled rice into 4 equal portions. 
            Keep your hands wet to keep rice from sticking. 
            Create an indention in one of the rice portions using your thumb. 
            Fill the indention with 1 teaspoon bonito flakes. 
            Top with another rice portion to close the onigiri. 
            Form into an oval shape and wrap the middle with a strip of nori. 
            Make another onigiri with the remaining ingredients. 
            Sprinkle white and black sesame seeds on top. Place in a bento box.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk together the eggs, mirin, and 1/8 teaspoon tamari together in a bowl; divide into 3 portions. Cut remaining portion of nori sheet into four 1/2-inch strips.
        </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a small saucepan or square tamagoyaki pan over medium-high heat. 
            Add 1/3 of the egg mixture and cook until almost firm, 
            2 to 3 minutes; if omelette is too firm, it won't stick together very well. 
            Slide onto a plate. Add the 4 strips of nori to the pan with some space between each.
        </li>
        <li>Cook another 1/3 of the omelette the same way, 
            but roll it up carefully in the saucepan with the nori. 
            Slide the rolled-up omelette onto the edge of the first omelette. 
            Cook the third omelette and roll it up, sliding it on top of the second omelette. 
            Let cool enough to touch, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Roll the entire layered omelette together with nori inside. Cut into 4 pieces. 
            Place into the bento box alongside the onigiri.
        </li>
        <li>Mix 2 tablespoons tamari, ginger, and wasabi paste together in a bowl. 
            Put the mixture into a portable container then put inside the bento box. 
            Add the steamed broccoli and edamame.
        </li>
    </ol>
